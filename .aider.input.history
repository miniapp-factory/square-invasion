+BACKGROUND EFFECT: "Square Rain"
+
+Fill the entire background with constant falling squares.
+
+Squares should be small, solid-colored, and randomly placed at the top of the screen.
+
+Each square falls straight down at a medium speed.
+
+When a square reaches the bottom, it disappears (or resets back to the top).
+
+Squares should appear continuously so it looks like rain made out of squares.
+
+Use various shades of the same color (for example: different purples or blues) to give a neon look.
+
+Keep the effect behind all gameplay elements (background layer only).
+
+Do not let the squares interact with the player or game objects—purely visual.
